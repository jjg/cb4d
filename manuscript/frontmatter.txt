# Introduction

The Chromebook was introduced as an inexpensive laptop computer designed to run web-based applications.  Over the years it has evolved beyond both these defining qualities, and through not-quite-manufacturer-supported methods it is possible to use a Chromebook as a true general-purpose computer.


# Why Bother?

With the wide assortment of computers avaliable that have been designed to run more flexible operations systems why would anyone want to own a device that is more limited by design?  One reason is price: the average cost of a new Chromebook is less than $500.00 USD, with some models costing as little as $200.00 USD.  But based on price alone there may be more attractive options.

However the Chromebook offers more to the aspiring or professional software developer.  Chromebooks on average tend to be more durable and well-designed compared to similar-priced laptops.  They are also often optimized for low-power operation which means longer battery life and less fan noise (some models have no fan at all).  Additionally as Chrome OS is Linux-based, all Chromebooks are inherently Linux-compatible (unlike many laptop computers which often have components like network cards that are difficult or even impossible to get working under Linux).

There are many other more complex or specific reasons to consider a Chromebook for software development that we'll discuss throughout the rest of this book.


# Who this book is for
Anyone who is interested in selecting a computer specifically for open-source software development or considering a secondary machine to dedicate to software development use.  Additionally anyone interested in learning more about what can be done with a Chromebook beyond browsing the web and using Google applications.
